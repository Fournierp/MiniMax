    "Now the State Space of TicTacToe (the 9 tiles) is quite limited so the One Step Lookahead is quite easy to develop. For more complex games like chess, developping a One Step Lookahead algorithm is more challenging. Indeed our TicTacToe script picks a random position when there is no winning move available. Yet for chess the approach to take would be to build a heuristic function. Even though I have not built one for this project, we can look at the purpose of such a function. As a player, there are position that are more advantageous; the heuristic function simply translates such preferences into a fitness score and the move with the highest score will be selected. In chess we could translate the capture of each piece with a reward which will direct the algorithm to prioritize important pieces over pawns.\n",
